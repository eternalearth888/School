			<h2>What I did this summer:</h2>
			<h3>Field Session</h3>
			<p> This past summer, I attended the Field Session course for my major. I, with a group of other students, created an Android App game for a non-profit organization for a charity called <a href="http://www.thegivingchild.org">The Giving Child</a></p>

			<h3> Florida and Family</h3>
			<p> After Field Session, I went to go visit my family in Florida. I made sure to relax and enjoy myself. I took the time to learn about myself and what I want in my life. Despite what it sounds like it was hard. I am not used to treating myself to things and learning to love myself and what not. But I learned a lot from the experience, and I am still learning more and more. I also made sure to spend a lot of time with my little sister, cause she is the one I tend to miss the most.</p>
