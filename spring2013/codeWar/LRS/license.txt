For all the code there is no license - you can do whatever you want with it. If 
you like it, we ask that you say something nice about Windward with a link to 
www.windward.net.

The art that is game specific came from the open source project 
http://robotournament.sourceforge.net. It has a GPL license but I'm not sure
how that applies to art as it discusses code. So no idea what restrictions
there are on it but probably GPL.

The general art came from www.iconexperience.com and you must buy their icons
to use them in anything else. They have really good icons and their prices are
reasonable so do purchase if you want to use their stuff.
