1.	Install Visual Studio 2010 (Professional version recomended).

2.	Install the game server.

3.	Extract PlayerCppAI from LastRobotStanding.zip.

4.	The following instructions are for installing boost c++ libraries. Your 
proctor may have already installed this on your system.
Download the boost installer from http://www.boostpro.com/download/. 

5.	Run the boost installer. you can either close Visual Studio before running 
the installer, or restart Visual Studio after running the installer.

6.	In the variants page, check Visual C++ 10.0 (Visual Studio 2010), and check 
the multithreaded debug, static runtime variant.

7.	In the components page, uncheck everything except for the following. Make 
sure you set them to have the green check mark, otherwise you'll get build 
errors.
	•	Boost header files (required)
	•	Boost DateTime
	•	Boost Regex
	•	Boost System
	•	Boost Thread
	•	Add to path

8.	On the destination page, copy the destination folder path to a system 
environment variable called BOOST_ROOT. The project is setup to use this 
environment variable, so if you don't set it, you'll get build errors.
The installer takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on your connection speed. 

9.	In Visual Studio go to File, Open, Project/Solution and go to the directory 
you extracted PlayerCppAI to. Open the file PlayerCppAI.sln.

10.	Open the project properties and set the command line arguments. The 
arguments are ip address of the server, your name, and your password.

11.	Start the game server.

12.	Run the client (CTRL+F5). You will get a command window that will print out 
turns, etc. You should see your client connected in the server window.

13.	Start a game on the server. You should see turns listed in the command 
window. If you do, you are successfully configured.

14.	One additional note: Sometimes Visual Studio produces incorrect IntelliSense
errors when you're working with C/C++. You can disable the error reporting of 
IntelliSense, which has no impact on build error reporting. Go to Tools > Text 
Editor > C/C++ > Advanced. Under the IntelliSense section, set Disable Error 
Reporting to True.
