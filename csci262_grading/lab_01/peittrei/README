README for CSCI Lab 1 

1. Include names of all people who helped/collaborated as per the syllabus.

	I did the assignment on my own with no assistance from any discussions or
	interactions with people. I did however use the textbook for this class as
	well as the textbook for the previous class equivalent (CSCI 261). I also
	used the Internet a bit for little odds and ends.

2. Describe the challenges you encountered and how you surmounted them.

	The flip horizontal took me the longest. I found I was losing track of how
	many columns were in a row. I made a 4 x 3 ppm file to assist in debugging
	this problem. I wound up using this little file while developing the other
	features as well. Horizontal blur was also tricky. Accounting columns was the
	hardest part of this.

3. What did you like/dislike about the assignment

	I enjoyed the modularity of this project. It was nice to have a working
	program after each new module addition.

	This is not a big deal BUT I was not sure if the suggested user interface was
	the required one. I think it is a bit silly with all the yes no questions. I
	would have preferred to implement it either as command line switches or some
	friendlier form of interaction. In the future it would be nice to know if it
	is okay to branch away from (and improve) any sample user interfaces.
